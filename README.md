Uncommon Hacks entry -- meme-based hackathon 
Inspiration
We were inspired to create this game based off of a board game called Tiki Topple. After looking online, we realized that there were no other apps with this gamestyle and the board game itself was discontinued. Now - with this game we made - we can continue playing this game forever!

What it does
The game allows for multiple players (2-4), and gives each player a score card that they each attempt to match using the move cards given to them.

How we built it
We built it using the ionic framework.
html, css, javascript
